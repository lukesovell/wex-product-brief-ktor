Sample Product Brief to get some practice to Kotlin, Ktor, and Exposed

TODO: 

* Add tests
* Database migration using Flyway

JDBI Thoughts:

While I appreciate writing the SQL out and not letting a library write it for me, I feel like I
was fighting with it a lot because of a lack of type safety. Exposed was much easier to get running on this 
front, but perhaps it doesn't provide as much flexibility.
